# leaving-earth-probs

This contains the code for the page vietafan.github.io/leaving-earth-probs, which calculates the probability that a player has each given card distribution for a technology in the game "Leaving Earth" given the sequence of outcomes (success, minor failure, major failure) that they have obtained. 

At the beginning of the game, the player has 3 unknown cards. Each is chosen from the following distribution: success 70%, minor failure 15%, major failure 15%. The page uses several JavaScript functions to calculate the probabilities given a sequence of outcomes and card buyouts using Bayes's Theorem and conditional probability.
